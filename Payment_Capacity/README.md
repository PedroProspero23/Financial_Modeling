# Payment Capacity Analysis App

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to analyze the payment capacity of companies through financial indicators. The application allows users to input financial data manually or upload a CSV file with multiple company records. Based on the input, it automatically calculates key financial ratios such as current liquidity, general liquidity, debt ratio, equity composition, financial independence, and interest coverage.

These indicators are essential in evaluating a company's ability to meet its short and long-term obligations and are commonly used by banks and financial institutions when assessing creditworthiness, especially in sectors such as agribusiness. However, the logic and structure of the tool are generic and can be applied to companies in any sector.

The app also includes automated chart generation to help users interpret the financial situation visually and intuitively. Each chart includes explanatory insights to assist those without deep financial knowledge. After the analysis is completed, users can export a full report in PDF format summarizing the results.

This repository contains the application script (`code_app.py`), example reference documents, and a generated report. To run the project locally, users need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file and execute the Streamlit app using the Streamlit CLI.

The application is hosted online and can be accessed through the following link:
