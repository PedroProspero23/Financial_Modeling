# Financial_Modeling

This repository brings together the financial modeling projects I’m building to deepen my understanding of financial analysis, business planning, and investment evaluation. With my academic background in Business Administration at the European International University in Paris and an MBA in Project Management at USP ESALQ (e-distance learning), I am particularly focused on connecting financial logic with data-driven tools to support decision-making in complex environments.

The models in this repository are designed to simulate real business scenarios — from forecasting cash flows and calculating net present value to evaluating investment risk, budgeting operations, and projecting returns under different assumptions. Each project is grounded in financial reasoning but supported by automated calculations and visual insights using Python, Excel, and Power BI. This integration allows me to not only create robust financial models but also deliver outputs that can be clearly understood and shared across technical and non-technical audiences.

Whether it's building a discounted cash flow (DCF) model for a farm operation, analyzing breakeven points for a startup, or simulating the financial impact of uncertainty using Monte Carlo methods, the purpose remains the same: bring structure, transparency, and clarity to financial decision-making.

This repository is constantly evolving as I explore new industries, improve my modeling practices, and seek to deliver financial insights that go beyond static spreadsheets. Each project is documented and structured to be replicable, educational, and aligned with the kinds of challenges faced in real businesses and investment environments.
